# Probability and Statistics Project

This repository contains the implementation and report for my *Probability and Statistics* course project at Sharif University of Technology, supervised by Dr. Seyed Mohammad Karbasi. The project combines theoretical analysis, proofs, and computational simulations on topics in probability theory, Markov chains, and game theory, with applications to stock investment strategies.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a sequence of theoretical exercises and coding tasks, covering:

- **Markov Chains**: transition probabilities, communicating classes, irreducibility, stationary distributions, and hitting times.  
- **Game Theory**: strategies, best responses, Nash equilibria in classical games (e.g., Prisoner’s dilemma, penalty shoot-out, rock–paper–scissors).  
- **Applications with NashPy**: using the Python library to compute equilibria.  
- **Data Analysis**: applying game theory to investment strategies with stock market data, including regression analysis and equilibrium point estimation.
